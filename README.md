Data surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic is so rapidly changing it makes it difficult to see the “flattening of the curve”. Here, I take today’s most up to date global dataset of COVID-19 cases and deaths and plot out the number of new cases/day (growth rate) against the total number of cases in a given day (averaged across the week) and visualize it on a logarithmic scale that helps to properly contextualize the nature of exponential growth and how countries are mitigating spread.

You can find code relating to importing the data and tidying it up in the [auxiliary.R](https://github.com/zhamadeh/Covid19_ExponentialGrowth_Shiny/blob/master/auxiliary.R) script and the user interface and serve code in the [app.R](https://github.com/zhamadeh/Covid19_ExponentialGrowth_Shiny/blob/master/app.R) script
